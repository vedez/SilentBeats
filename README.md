# Project About
**Project Name:** Silent Beats
**Description:**
This project develops a virtual reality simulator for playing drums, aimed at providing drummers with a realistic practice environment without the need for a physical drum kit. The VR Drum Simulator replicates the experience of playing a traditional drum set, including accurate sound production and dynamic response to stick movements, enabling users to practice quietly and without taking up physical space. This tool is ideal for drummers looking to practice at any time without causing noise disruptions.

# How it works
When the game is launched, the user is transported into a floating fantasy island where they can freeplay with the available drumkit
There is two modes to the game, Freestyle Mode (Where the user can play what they wish) or Tutorial Mode (Where the game shows basic drum patterns for the user to practice)
The user can turn on or off an in game metronome and set the BPM to what they wish to practice on

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
I enjoyed making the environment/universe for the game, it was very interesting to create a world using models.


I also liked utilising the mushrooms for the drums in order to create a more visual practice space.


Lastly, the frog I added as a small easter egg with a sound cue.

# What I learned
- How to create shapes / meshes
- How to integrate sounds and interactions with those shapes using collisions
- How to create parent/child relationships between scenes in Godot
- Basic Godot Scripting
- Reading documentation
- How to build an environment in Godot (Sky, ground, flora)
- Basic drum skills from practicing using the app

# Proposal submitted earlier can go here:
Initially I was going to build a rhythm game using drums and importing various rhythm game maps/resources, but I thought it was more fun to practice the drums as you would in real life, as well as having a practice mode where you can learn how to actually play drums.
A future implementation to the game could be a rhythm game like process to practice mode, which allows the user to have a more challenging experience to staying on beat.
